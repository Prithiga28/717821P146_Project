        <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything was made from scratch so never in a million years did I imagined how much fun I was going to have baking for my community.  When I say baked from scratch, I mean that I use basic ingredients from start to finish. I make buttercream frosting with real butter and our custom cakes, cinnamon rolls, and cookies made completely from scratch with farm-fresh local eggs and real butter. If you have questions about any ingredient please feel free to ask. </h2>
